## Coding exercise:

Write the HTML and CSS to display a keyboard on the page with this layout:

Add JavaScript (feel free to use jQuery or another library of your choice) so that when you click on a white key the key is highlighted and the corresponding letter is appended to an element below the keyboard that acts as a log.

Add a text field and play button below the log element. When a comma delimited string of letters is entered into the text field and the play button is clicked it should highlight the appropriate keys in order for one second at a time.
