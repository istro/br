## Coding exercise:

Write the HTML and CSS to display a keyboard on the page with this layout:

Add JavaScript (feel free to use jQuery or another library of your choice) so that when you click on a white key the key is highlighted and the corresponding letter is appended to an element below the keyboard that acts as a log.

Add a text field and play button below the log element. When a comma delimited string of letters is entered into the text field and the play button is clicked it should highlight the appropriate keys in order for one second at a time.

### Notes as I go along:

- For simplicity's sake I'll keep it all in one file (although in real world this is also useful - if latency and connection speed are important factors (e.g. if you're targeting mobile users in china)). I'll also publish it to [github pages](http://istro.github.io/br/).

- Starting with feature creep - added a iphone-sized variant of css.
